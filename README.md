NAME
====

Text::Emoji - provide :text: to emoji translation

SYNOPSIS
========

```raku
use Text::Emoji;

say to-emoji("I :heart: :beer:");  # I ‚ù§Ô∏è üç∫

say to-text(":I: ‚ù§Ô∏è üç∫");  # I :heart: :beer:
```

DESCRIPTION
===========

The `Text::Emoji` distribution contains information about transforming `:text:` to emoji transliteration. As such it exports a number of subroutines.

It also installs a convenience script `em` that will convert to emojis any arguments from the command line or from standard input.

SUBROUTINES
===========

to-emoji
--------

```raku
say to-emoji("I :heart: :beer:");                     # I ‚ù§Ô∏è üç∫

say to-emoji("I :love: :beer:", :love<‚ù§Ô∏è>);           # I ‚ù§Ô∏è üç∫
say to-emoji("I :love: :beer:", :love<heart>);        # I ‚ù§Ô∏è üç∫
say to-emoji("I :love: :beer:", %(love => "‚ù§Ô∏è"));     # I ‚ù§Ô∏è üç∫
say to-emoji("I :love: :beer:", %(love => "heart"));  # I ‚ù§Ô∏è üç∫

say to-emoji("baby: :baby-bottle::babybottle:");  # baby: üçºüçº
```

The `to-emoji` subroutine in its simplest form takes a string as the first argument and attempt to transform any known emoji strings of the form `:word:` into the associated emoji. Note that the word *may* contain hyphens, but they are optional.

Additional mapping info may be specified as additional named arguments, or as a hash. The value for each additional mapping may be either the emoji directly, or the text equivalent of the emoji.

to-text
-------

```raku
say to-text("I ‚ù§Ô∏è üç∫");                      # I :heart: :beer:
say to-text("I ‚ù§Ô∏è üç∫", :love<‚ù§Ô∏è>);           # I :love: :beer:
say to-text("I ‚ù§Ô∏è üç∫", :love<heart>);        # I :love: :beer:
say to-text("I ‚ù§Ô∏è üç∫", %(love => "‚ù§Ô∏è"));     # I :love: :beer:
say to-text("I ‚ù§Ô∏è üç∫", %(love => "heart"));  # I :love: :beer:
```

The `to-text` subroutine in its simplest form takes a string as the first argument and attempt to transform any known emojis to the shortest possible `:word:` form known for that emoji.

The same type of additional map information as can be specified with `to-emoji`, can be specified with `to-text`.

raw-emoji-data
--------------

```raku
say raw-emoji-data<‚ù§Ô∏è>.keys;
# (aliases category description emoji ios_version tags unicode_version)
```

The `raw-emoji-data` subroutine returns a `Map`, keyed to the supported emojis. The value associated with is a `Map` as well, which can be best described by its JSON representation:

    {
      "emoji": "‚ù§Ô∏è",
      "description": "red heart",
      "category": "Smileys & Emotion",
      "aliases": [
        "heart"
      ],
      "tags": [
        "love"
      ],
      "unicode_version": "",
      "ios_version": "6.0"
    }

SCRIPTS
=======

em
--

    $ em I :heart: :beer:
    I ‚ù§Ô∏è üç∫

    $ echo I :heart: :beer: | em
    I ‚ù§Ô∏è üç∫

The `em` script converts any text given either on the command line, or from STDIN, to emojis where appropriate.

INSPIRATION
===========

Inspired by Simon Harms' [`Avolution::Emoji`](https://github.com/ukn-ubi/Avolution-Emoji) module, but completely re-imagined from scratch using the table provided by the [`gemoji`](https://github.com/github/gemoji) library.
