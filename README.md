NAME
====

Text::Emoji - provide :text: to emoji translation

SYNOPSIS
========

```raku
use Text::Emoji;

say to-emoji("I :heart: :beer:");  # I ‚ù§Ô∏è üç∫
```

DESCRIPTION
===========

The `Text::Emoji` distribution exports a single subroutine `to-emoji`.

SUBROUTINES
===========

to-emoji
--------

```raku
say to-emoji("I :heart: :beer:");                     # I ‚ù§Ô∏è üç∫

say to-emoji("I :love: :beer:", :love<‚ù§Ô∏è>);           # I ‚ù§Ô∏è üç∫
say to-emoji("I :love: :beer:", :love<heart>);        # I ‚ù§Ô∏è üç∫
say to-emoji("I :love: :beer:", %(love => "‚ù§Ô∏è"));     # I ‚ù§Ô∏è üç∫
say to-emoji("I :love: :beer:", %(love => "heart"));  # I ‚ù§Ô∏è üç∫

say to-emoji("baby: :baby-bottle::babybottle:");  # baby: üçºüçº
```

The `to-emoji` subroutine in its simplest form takes a string as the first argument and attempt to transform any known emoji strings of the form `:word:` into the associated emoji. Note that the word *may* contain hyphens, but they are optional.

Additional mapping info may be specified as additional named arguments, or as a hash. The value for each additional mapping may be either the emoji directly, or the text equivalent of the emoji.

INSPIRATION
===========

Inspired by Simon Harms' [`Avolution::Emoji`](https://github.com/ukn-ubi/Avolution-Emoji) module, but completely re-imagined from scratch using the table provided by the [`gemoji`](https://github.com/github/gemoji) library.
