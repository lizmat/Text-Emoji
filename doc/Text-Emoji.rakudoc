Text::Emoji - provide :text: to emoji translation

=head1 SYNOPSIS

=begin code :lang<raku>

use Text::Emoji;

say to-emoji("I :heart: :beer:");  # I ‚ù§Ô∏è üç∫

=end code

=head1 DESCRIPTION

The C<Text::Emoji> distribution exports a single subroutine C<to-emoji>
which takes a single string argument.  It then attempts to translate
any emoji text shortcuts to the actual unicode equivalent.

=head1 INSPIRATION

Inspired by Simon Harms' L<C<Avolution::Emoji>|https://github.com/ukn-ubi/Avolution-Emoji>
module, but completely re-imagined from scratch using the table provided
by the L<C<gemoji>|https://github.com/github/gemoji> library.
