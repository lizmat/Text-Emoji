=end code

The C<to-emoji> subroutine in its simplest form takes a string as the
first argument and attempt to transform any known emoji strings of the
form C<:word:> into the associated emoji.  Note that the word I<may>
contain hyphens, but they are optional.

Additional mapping info may be specified as additional named arguments,
or as a hash.  The value for each additional mapping may be either the
emoji directly, or the text equivalent of the emoji.

=head1 INSPIRATION

Inspired by Simon Harms' L<C<Avolution::Emoji>|https://github.com/ukn-ubi/Avolution-Emoji>
module, but completely re-imagined from scratch using the table provided
by the L<C<gemoji>|https://github.com/github/gemoji> library.
